================

Plush controller with USB for games with [Adafruit Flora](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit_flora_game_controller).

The firmware uses the [CapPin Library](https://github.com/moderndevice/CapSense) for measure the capcaity on the 8 pins on the Adafruit Flora controller. The threshold is set to a minimum to boost the reaction time of the Flora.
